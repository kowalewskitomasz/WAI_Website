# WAI_Website
Student's project - Website built using PHP, HTML and CSS with MVC pattern

My goal was to create website that works as a photo gallery and has implemented mechanism to tell apart many users and show only photos they choose to be shown.

### List of all functionalities
* Sending files onto server and show them in gallery tab. Only files in PNG or JPG format and size <1MB are accepted
* Field to choose second image which is used as a watermark for your photo
* Gallery in which all sent files thumbnails are shown
* Usage of MongoDB database, all info about sent photos is passed to database
* "Register" and "Login" forms
* Usage of AJAX to find photos in gallery based on their name
